<h3 align="start">Hey there! I’m Caio 👋</h3>

I’m a passionate **Software Engineer** 🧑‍💻, crafting awesome apps with a side of caffeine ☕.

With 5+ years of front-end and back-end wizardry, I thrive on turning complex problems into elegant code that just works. Right now, I’m building things with **React** and **Node.js**.

🚀 At **Hotmart**, I helped scale a video player for millions of users, and at **Samba Tech**, I worked on digital transformation projects that pushed the limits of what’s possible.

🤖 When I’m not writing code, you’ll find me diving deep into **AI**, exploring the world of **game development**, or hunting down the next tech trend to obsess over.

Let’s build something amazing together! Feel free to fork my repos, drop an issue, or just reach out! 👾
